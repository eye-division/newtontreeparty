<p>Late in his life, whilst an old man then living in London, Isaac recounted a scene that his mother had often told him. She said that:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&#8220;when he was born he was so little that they could have put him into a quart pot, &amp; so unlikely to live that two women who were sent to my Lady Packenham at North Witham for something for him sate down on a stile by the way and said to one another that they need not make haste for the child would certainly be dead before they could get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>It has always been fruitfull for social historians to examine the small things from the past. It has a name &#8211; “micro-history”. Small details &#8211; overlooked by historians who worry about our past at a national level &#8211; can carry with them the clues, which when pursued with care and perseverence, can lead us to quite new and interesting facts. So it is with this throwaway recollection of Isaac&#8217;s. To the curious mind it immediately raises several questions. Why did his mother often tell him of this event? Who were the two women? Why send women not men? Why send two? Where is the stile they sat on? What sort of thing would they be sent for? Why were they sent to North Witham? The answer &#8211; to see “my Lady Pakenham” &#8211; begs the futher question, why her, and who is Lady Pakenham anyway? Why was the infant Isaac so little, and why would they expect him to die quickly? These questions are easy to ask, but in answering them the social historian will be lead deep into the everyday lives of our ancestors living in the seventeenth century, and the colour and detail which is often revealed will never fail to enthrall us.</p>
<p>North Witham is a small parish about a mile south of Woolsthorpe and Colsterworth, where Isaac was born on Christmas day 1642, a few months after the outbreak of the English civil war. Isaac already had connections with the parish when he was born, and they increased during his life.</p>
<p>In 1611 Isaac&#8217;s uncle William Ayscough, brother to his mother Hannah, was baptized there in the parish church of St Mary&#8217;s. Isaac&#8217;s cousin William Newton (son of his great uncle Richard) was probably the William who married Ellenor Packington in this parish in November 1641 &#8211; the year before Isaac was born. Also starting a family in the parish when Isaac was born was one William Cottam and his wife Elizabeth. William was probably a servant to the rector Barnabus Smith, because he was later servant to Isaac&#8217;s mother Hannah and mentioned in her will of 1673, which was written by Isaac himself. William Cottam (or more likely his son of the same name who was born in 1629) was then servant in the 1680s to Isaac&#8217;s half-sister Mary and her husband Thomas Pilkington; and finally he was servant to Isaac himself.</p>
<p>At the time Isaac was born all these people were living in North Witham, and also the mysterious “Lady Jane Pakenham”. She is mysterious because she could not claim the title of Lady, as she was married to plain Clement Pakenham, Esquire. His brother, Sir Henry Pakenham, died years ealier, and Henry&#8217;s widow Lady Jane Pakenham was remarried and dead by the time the two women set off to North Witham. So who is the “Lady Pakenham” that Hannah spoke so often of? She is Jane the wife of Clement, but we do not know her maiden name. It is possible however that she is the distant cousin of Isaac&#8217;s, Jane the daughter of William Newton, younger brother of Isaac&#8217;s great grandfather Richard Newton. Further searching in the records for her marriage should reveal her identity. Interestingly this Jane had a sister Mary who married Thomas Vincent of this parish in 1595 and may still be living here at the time of Isaac&#8217;s birth.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>When Isaac was three his widowed mother Hannah remarried the rector of North Witham, and lived</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div title="Page 2">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>in the rectory next to the church, both of which are still there today. Contrary to preceding accounts and research Barnabus was neither a bachelor nor a widow when he arranged his marriage to Hannah. He was in fact married to Dionis, who lived estranged from him in Oakam, Rutland. She was buried there on 29 December 1645, just over two weeks before Barnabus remarried. All of his three half siblings by Barnabus were baptized by him in the church. Isaac stayed behind in Woolsthorpe, but as a young man in 1662, he recalled:</p>
<p>“Threatning my father and mother Smith to burne them and the house [the rectory] over them..“</p>
<p>The rectory still stands, Isaac never followed through on his threat &#8211; thankfully. His mother, widowed again, returned from North Witham after her husband&#8217;s death in 1653 to live in the house he built for her &#8211; her dower house &#8211; which now stands at Woolsthorpe, conserved by the National Trust. The house that Isaac was born in was pulled down by Edmond Turnor in 1798, at the very same time that he erected a plaque in an upper room of the dower house identifying it as Isaac&#8217;s birthplace. The original manor foundations lie under the grass in the field next to the present house. Therein lies another story.</p>
<p>These stories and many more are documented in Russell Newton&#8217;s forthcoming book about Isaac&#8217;s life &#8211; Mr Newton&#8217;s New Perspective.</p>
