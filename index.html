<p>The Newton Tree Party set out to uncover Isaac Newton’s family connections in the Lincolnshire landscape. We wanted to retrace the footpaths and routes that Newton would walked between different villages, family houses and buildings  over 300 years ago. Now in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century the Newton Tree Party celebrates these routes and their stories through walks, creative events and social media.</p>

<p>A special workshop in Colsterworth Village Hall helped kick start the project in February 2014. The session aimed to use local knowledge to retrace the branches of the Newton family tree and to identify how they related to the landscape. Community members, local historians and Newton family descendants were invited to bring stories, photographs and maps and to share local knowledge. Historian and Newton descendant Russell Newton also shared his unique research from his forthcoming book Mr Newton’s New Perspective.</p>

<p>Long distance walk specialists, Ali Pretty and Richard White were brought in to work with the local community to help design and lead the walks.  Ali &amp; Richard lead long distance walks that creatively explore the history of landscapes by inviting participants to record thoughts and reflections through visual arts and digital media. Audiences from around the world can track and interact with the routes and walkers through various social media platforms – a perfect combination for the Newton Tree Party!</p>
<p>From the meeting in Colsterworth 10 key locations were identified, each with a significant story to tell about Newton, whether it was his place of birth, a house where he spent time on his research, or a walking route to see an uncle or attend school.</p>

<p>The Grantham Museum expanded the project by heading up a successful Arts Council bid that supported Richard and Ali’s creative work in the community.  This enabled Ali &amp; Richard to offer silk banner and digital media workshops that would integrate into the walks.  Community members were invited to help design flags that would reflect key locations in the Newton Footsteps story and to provide a multi-media backdrop to the walks that would enable remote contributions and discussions on platforms such as Twitter, Flickr, Social Hiking, Facebook and the project blog.</p>

<p>The final Newton’s Footsteps walks were held over a two-day period during the Gravity Fields Festival in September 2014. Colourful flags were presented to community bearers along the route and the walkers were greeted by the local community along their way.  Audiences from around the world were invited to join the walks through social  media platforms and comments and questions came in from places as far afield as India and Australia. You can see how the story unfolded through these platforms:</p>

				<p><em>In his final piece for the Newton Tree Party blog, historian Russell Newton shares his personal thoughts and research on the birth place of Isaac Newton, Woolthorpe Manor. Find out more in his forthcoming book &#8216;Mr Newton&#8217;s New Perspective&#8217;.</em></p>
<p>Standing above a Lincolnshire spring of the river Witham on a rolling, gently undulating, grass-green hill and looking over towards the church about half a mile to the east is Woolsthorpe manor house. History is a story of stories. There is no historical account which is not already a retelling of someone else&#8217;s earlier stories. These stories acquire variations, mutations perhaps, and come down to us with differences, but usually with some common theme or purpose.</p>
<p>There is such a collection of stories associated with the house now standing at Woolsthorpe. The story goes that Isaac himself was born in this house, in the first floor room at the north end of house, now called the Red Chamber. According to these stories the house we see today was built either by Isaac Newton&#8217;s grandfather, Robert Newton, between 1623 and 1639, or in “the late 16th or early 17th century”, both versions of the story say that it is built <strong>on the foundations </strong>of an earlier manor house.</p>
<p>These is however persuasive evidence that points to a different story &#8211; that the present house wasn&#8217;t built on the foundations of the old house in the late 1500s to early 1600s or between 1623 and 1639, but in fact was build next to the original manor house between <strong>1646 and 1653</strong>, the original remained alongside the present house and then pulled down about 150 years later. Isaac could not have been born in the Red Chamber but next door.</p>
<p><strong> 1 Where does the story begin?</strong></p>
<p>History is partly detective work. This wouldn&#8217;t be necessary if those in past had left us detailed accounts of their lives. The evidence for the historical detective lays in old manuscripts, in old obscure books, and in the physical things we can examine today. In order to flush out the truth about Isaac&#8217;s birthplace we are going to have to dig deep for our evidence, and piece together a picture. The story begins in around 1797 when Edmund Turnor who owned the manor house erected a plaque in the room on the first floor in the north of the house, stating that it was in that very room that Isaac Newton first saw the light. He was a major landowner in south Lincolnshire, and had an interest was an antiquarian and Fellow of the Royal Society. His father and grandfather were also called Edmund, so for clarity I will call him Edmond III, his father Edmund II, and grandfather Edmund I. The family had lived at Stoke Rocheford, just north of Woolsthorpe, since the seventeenth century, and succeeding generations lived there into the modern era. Edmund I acquired the manor of Woolsthorpe in 1733 after John Newton, Isaac Newton&#8217;s heir-at-law, defaulted on debts and lost the estate to his creditors. Edmund I was probably acquainted with Isaac some years before not least because he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1702, the year before Isaac became its President.</p>
<p>If Edmund III is right in identifying the actual room where Isaac first drew breath, then it might be possible to follow the re-telling of our story back into the C17. A few years earlier, in 1797, a plan exists which identifies the present house as Isaac&#8217;s birthplace, and the room under which he was born, now at the Grantham museum. Various sketches of the exterior of the house were made, and seem to concentrate in the period 1770-1800. In 1781 Edmund III or his father sent a plan of the first floor to the Gentleman&#8217;s magazine, who published it. In 1778 an anonymous reader of the Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine visited Woolsthorpe, spoke to the tenant, sketched the house, and sent it to the magazine, indicating the Red Chamber as Isaac&#8217;s birthplace. In 1788 De La Motte included a reproduction of this one in a book published that year citing it “chamber and house in which Sir Isaac Newton was borne”. In 1772 another artist &#8211; T. Tinkley &#8211; drew the house for Thomas Maude, who was to include it in his Wensleydale. The title indicates that Isaac was born in the house, but does not indicate a room.</p>
<p>The 1772 drawing is the earliest record in the mid-C18 of an identification of the present house with Isaac&#8217;s birthplace. The anonymous contributor of 1778 is perfectly bold in his assertions, and importantly he is the first known source to identify the first floor room at the north end of the house as the actual room in which Isaac was born. Oddly he makes no qualification to his claim, such as “thought to be” or “said to be” &#8211; it is presented as a certainty. What is also strange about this drawing is that, not only is it very detailed and unlikely to be knocked out in an hour or so, but also that the anonymous author took the substantial trouble and expense to have an engraver copy it on copper-plate for printing, their name appears at the bottom of the engraving.</p>
<p>The pictures and plan tell us only that there was no evidence of an oral history of Isaac&#8217;s birth in the Red Chamber before 1778, and that the only source at this date is very modest and has gone to a lot of trouble but insists on remaining anonymous, whilst failing to tell us of their source. We must look further for other stories of the house.</p>
<p><strong>2. Are there other accounts?</strong></p>
<p>When Edmund III submitted his plan to the Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine in 1781 he did it “t<strong>o compleat Dr. Stukeley&#8217;s account</strong> the birth-place of Sir Isaac Newton&#8230;which shews at once the room in which Sir Isaac was born..”. What then was Dr. Stukeley&#8217;s account? Dr. Stukeley was William Stukeley, a Lincolnshire man, sometime friend of Isaac&#8217;s in London, who wrote a manuscript of Isaac&#8217;s life, which was never published. He contributed several stories of Isaac&#8217;s early years from various people who knew Isaac including Isaac himself. He visited Woolsthorpe at least twice. He first visited on Friday, 13 Oct 1721, on his tour of England, and was in the parish again on 11 June 1727 a few months after Isaac&#8217;s death, this time visiting the rector Mr Mason in the company of Ralph Clarke, whose grandfather had lodged Isaac when a boy at the Grantham free school. On the first visit Stukeley was shown around the house by the tenants, and sketched both the house and Colsterworth church. When he finished the sketch of the present house, he wrote underneath</p>
<p><em>“The mannor house of Wulsthorp in the parish of Colsterworth Lincolnshire, w<strong>here Sr. Isaac Newton was born</strong>: being his own estate.”</em></p>
<p>He reports that the tenants “carried me upstairs and show&#8217;d me Sir Isaac&#8217;s study, in which he used to sit, when he came home from Cambridge to see his mother”. After visiting Colsterworth he etched his own copperplate engraving from his sketch of the church and had a print made. The title of Stukeley&#8217;s drawing of the house is consonant with Turnor&#8217;s later story, but does not specify the Red Chamber. However, Stukeley does not keep to this account. Six years later, in four letters to Dr Richard Mead, he writes of Isaac&#8217;s mother that she</p>
<p><em>“had left Wolsthorpe &amp; liv&#8217;d with her second husband at North Witham. but upon his death after she had three children by him, she returned to her own house, which likewise as it ought to be remembered, was rebuilt by him”. (my emphasis)</em></p>
<p>Isaac&#8217;s mother Hannah, then a widow of about three years, married the clergyman Barnabus Smith at North Witham on 17 January 1646 and he died in August 1653. Stukeley also says that Isaac “was born in the Mannor house which was the family estate, where they hold a Court leet &amp; Court baron”. But later still, after making further enquiries into Isaac&#8217;s life for John Conduitt, who was proposing to write a biography of his life, he came up with more details. During her marriage to Barnabus, Hannah</p>
<p><em> “lived all this while at north witham, in her husbands rectory house. but now she went back to her own house, at Wulsthorp. this house being the present one, was built by M[aste]r. Smith but not of so large a form as the old one, wh[ich] was become very ruinous; that wherein S[i]r Isaac was born” (Stukeley&#8217;s emphasis).</em></p>
<p>Stukeley is not, and never was, the most reliable of sources. His accounts are many times factually inaccurate, as we know from other documentary evidence. This last account is dated 1752, and he must have collected more information since his visits in the 1720s, as the account is far more detailed, and he is very specific about the existence of two houses, underlining &#8216;that&#8217; to differentiate Isaac&#8217;s birthplace from the &#8216;present one&#8217; which is Hannah&#8217;s own house. I think it is revealing that although he is shown around the house in 1721, he is not shown the Red chamber, does not mention any room where Isaac was born, but is shown a room where Isaac had his study. This is not the last version of Stukeley&#8217;s account.</p>
<p>There is also a hint that there is more than one account in the years following Isaac&#8217;s death in 1727. After Stukeley has submitted his findings to John Conduitt, the latter then appears to refer to a dispute about the place of Isaac&#8217;s birth, but then thinks better of it, and omits any reference to contention. He writes, but then crosses out:</p>
<p><em><del> “That there may be no contention hereafter &#8230; about the place of the birth of this Homer of Philosophy, let me take notice that</del> &#8211; [all crossed out]</em></p>
<p><em>[he continues] He was born at the Mannor house of his family at Wolstrope in the parish of Colsterworth in the County of Lincoln”.</em></p>
<p>John Conduitt appears to know of some contention but preferred not to mention it. At this time none of these manuscripts and letters were published. If Stukeley is right then there is one site and two houses, the first one, in which Isaac was born, being replaced between 1646 and 1653 at the expense of Barnabus Smith, Isaac&#8217;s hated step-father. Isaac could not have been born in the Red Chamber, but was born on the same site, which is consistent with William Stukeley&#8217;s sketch of 1721.</p>
<p><strong> One house or two?</strong></p>
<p>However, there is a <strong>third account</strong> which is also contentious and has remained <strong>hidden</strong>. It comes to us from a representative of a family who probably lived constantly in Woolsthorpe since the 1600s, forming a continuous line of oral tradition from the days of Isaac&#8217;s grandfather. It is not known to any of Isaac&#8217;s biographers. The source of this account is one Samuel Atter. According to his own account he:</p>
<p><em> “lived all his days in close proximity to the birth-place of Sir Isaac Newton, of whom he had many anecdotes, which had been handed down to him by his parents. He used to contend that Sir Isaac Newton was not born in the present manor house, but in a house adjacent, which was taken down 60 or 70 years ago; and he was accustomed to point to some beams in his own cottage, and tracery in the walls which he said came from the original manor-house in which the great philosopher first saw the light.”</em></p>
<p>The claims by Samuel Atter are mentioned in the Latest Intelligence section of the Stamford Mercury newspaper and were read by a puzzled reader, one Edward Peacock, who then observed that:</p>
<p><em>“I was <strong>not aware that there was any doubt</strong> <strong>whatever</strong> as to the birthplace of the most illustrious of our Lincolnshire worthies. All biographies that I have seen agree on this head, and <strong>many prints</strong> have been issued of the present Woolsthorpe manor on account of its supposed interesting connexion with Sir Isaac Newton. It is highly desirable that as a doubt has arisen on this matter, <strong>it should be set at rest as soon as possible</strong>&#8230;”</em></p>
<p>Edward Peacock (if he were alive) would still be waiting, as no reply was made to his request for confirmation. Who then is Samual Atter, and can he be taken as a credible witness, and why has this story been buried? His obituary tells us that he was born in Woolsthorpe on 1 Apr 1759, by 1851 he was living on Spring Lane in Woolsthorpe and was 91 years old, he died on 10 August 1859 in his 101st year. By his own account Samuel lived his whole life in Woolsthorpe. There is almost certainly a continuous line of family to Samual Atter from a tenant of Woolsthorpe manor called Lawrence Otter in the 1600s. Laurence Otter knew Isaac well. He was a labourer born in the hamlet in 1628 fourteen years before Isaac, and was aged 57 in 1683. His father would have been a tenant of Isaac&#8217;s grandfather and father. He gave evidence in that year at the Angel in Grantham during a legal dispute between Isaac and the freeholders of Woolsthorpe and Colsterworth over some common land. The story is now getting interesting. But can we find some evidence to support this claim from Samuel, and why has it been buried?</p>
<p><strong> A house rediscovered</strong></p>
<p>We saw in the last blog that there may be two manor houses in Woolsthorpe. Looking around the casual observer could be forgiven for not finding that account credible. To each side of the present house is a garden, a field or outbuildings, there is no evidence of an old manor house. Aerial photographs and Google Earth reveal no house footprints in the vicinity, although there is evidence of a floor to the south of the house, underneath the present toilet block, and under the site of an 18th century dovecote. Is there any other documentary evidence of a house which matches the description of being bigger than the present house, standing adjacent to it, and which was pulled down between 1790 and 1800?</p>
<p>The answer, surprisingly, is yes. Standing a few meters away from the present house, and matching this description exactly, was a house known as Widow Newton&#8217;s house or the Dower house. It matches the expectation derived from Stukeley and Atter. This house is adjacent to the present house, with a larger footprint, and was pulled down by Edmund III around 1798. It is inside what is now known as either Beeson&#8217;s Close or Newton&#8217;s Close. Not only was the house pulled down, but there is today absolutely no physical evidence that it ever existed, its footprint lies in a field grazed by sheep, a few meters east and north of the present house.</p>
<p>The details of its location and footprint is, however, available due to a lucky accident and we may be thankful to the random curiosity that led Professor John Robison to visit Woolsthorpe over 200 years ago, in 1796, while on his way to London &#8211; just as Stukeley had 70 years before him. As a result of his diversion he commissioned, in 1796 or 97, four views of the present house from an artist called J.C. Barrow. Barrow drew several sketches of the interior of the house and some water-colours of the exterior as well as a plan of the house and messuage. This fact is noted by &#8216;R. Robison&#8217; in 1814 on the plan, who “thought it right to give this explanation [of the commission]” as he “accompanied Mr Robison on that occasion” and was “personally acquainted with the history of the drawings”. Importantly this plan shows not only the present manor house in its present position but also shows the outline of another house called “Widow Newton&#8217;s house” on the plan. There are two residents, the house being split into two, and one is Richard Otter who is probably Samuel Otter&#8217;s relation, perhaps his father. It is not clear who he is, but he must be of the same family as Isaac&#8217;s contemporary Lawrence Otter and the teller of this new story, Samuel, but <strong>further genealogical work should determine it.</strong></p>
<p><strong> We now have three competing narratives of Isaac&#8217;s birthplace.</strong> <strong>Is it possible to discount any of them?</strong> We can look at three other sources of evidence to help us determine which story is most likely to be true. We can look at the building itself, the inventories taken when a householder died, and lastly the hearth tax records.</p>
<p><strong> Can we date the architecture of the present house to late 16th century or early 17th century?</strong></p>
<p>The story of a rebuild by Isaac&#8217;s grandfather Robert Newton between 1623 and 1639 or an earlier rebuild could be confirmed if we could date the house exclusively to this time-frame. According to Isaac&#8217;s working papers (confirmed by Edmund III, both of whom had access to the title deeds), Robert Newton purchased the manor and manor house in 1623. Interestingly the title deeds now appear to be lost. In the mid C16 it was owned by Thimelby family, then for two generations of the Bury family then Robert Underwater before it came to Robert Newton. There is no date stone which would end any debate, but are there any architectural historians who have dated it? In the 1960s Nicholas Pevsner visited and recorded that Woolsthorpe manor house was:</p>
<p><em>“unpretentious, but a good example of a small C17 manor house. Conventional T-plan of c. 1620, with one-, two-, three-light windows all with straight hoods.” (emphasis mine)</em></p>
<p>The present house has been described to be constructed in brick of “double Flemish garden wall bond”. Pevsner is a rightly admired and respected recorder of English architectural history. However there are houses both before and after this date in the area which are of the same design and construction. It is difficult bordering on impossible to assess the fashion, design, material, or build construction in vernacular buildings and conclude a date within the necessary parameters in this case.</p>
<p><strong> Are there other documents we can use?</strong></p>
<p>When someone died an inventory of their goods, stock and animals in their house and on their land was taken &#8211; not all of them survive, but we are lucky because inventories do survive for both Isaac Newton&#8217;s father &#8211; Isaac Newton senior &#8211; and for his wife Hannah Smith. Inventories are taken room by room and should follow some kind of order as the writer moves through the house. If Edmund III is right then the inventories should describe the same house in October 1642 when Isaac Newton senior died and in 1679 when Isaac&#8217;s mother Hannah died, in other words t<strong>he inventories should reconcile with each other.</strong> It should also be possible to <strong>reconcile both inventories with the present house.</strong> However, we know that the present house was remodelled inside so we would have to re-imagine its interior before comparing with the inventories. The old staircase in the rear from ground to first floor was removed and is apparently now in Colsterworth manor, although the staircase from first floor to second floor remains in the house but may have been slightly repositioned, the staircase was replaced with a new smaller one placed inside the house in the little parlour. Turnor removed the remaining two dormers which appear in the 1797 watercolour. The large C18th kitchen is made smaller, but an extra room is added above it, where the hayloft was. The remodelling makes the interior of the house much smaller, cramped, and less well-lit, with a wide, well-lit and spacious, C17th staircase at the rear removed, and the light-giving dormer windows in the second floor taken away.</p>
<p>In October 1642 Isaac&#8217;s father&#8217;s house has two stories, one staircase (not mentioned), and no cellar. There are three rooms on the ground floor, namely a Hall, the first room entered from the outside, there is a kitchen and a parlour. It is likely that the Hall is at one end of the house, with the kitchen next and the parlour at the other end. There seem to be stairs from the parlour to the chamber over it, then (working back along the house) a chamber over the buttery (or kitchen I presume) and one over the hall. There are five beds, implying Isaac &amp; Hannah with one, plus four servants. Isaac &amp; Hannah perhaps had the chamber over the parlour as it has just one bed. There is a “new” stable with the house. Hannah&#8217;s house by contrast has three stories, two staircases, a cellar, and four rooms on the ground floor &#8211; not three. The first room entered (looking at the actual building) is the little parlour, it could never be a Hall, as it is the smallest room. There are nine beds in her house. The room names are different but they could have been named by Hannah. The new stable mentioned in 1642 is absent from Hannah&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>It is plain that these inventories describe two distinct houses, but that Hannah&#8217;s can be easily reconciled to the present house after taking account of known remodelling, and that her husband&#8217;s house cannot be reconciled to the present house. We can conclude that the present house is not the house that Isaac&#8217;s father died owning, but that the present house is the house that his mother died owning. The earlier owners may still have inventories which could be compared, and <strong>this work has still to be done</strong>. There is however no will or inventory for Isaac&#8217;s grandfather Robert Newton who died in 1641. Earlier owners may have left one, for example Richard Thimelby of Irnham, or Gilbert Bury. It may be possible to find inventories of the later tenants of Isaac&#8217;s at his mother&#8217;s house for example Mr Birch, Thomas Percivall, John Newton the heir-at-law, and the Woolerton family. <strong>This work has yet to carried out.</strong></p>
<p>The inventories examined so far show that that there were two houses, and that Isaac was not born in the present one. However, we cannot distinguish which of the stories from Stukeley or Atter is more reasonable. If Atter is right then there should be evidence of two substantial houses in the tiny hamlet of Woolsthorpe after the 1650s, and if Stukeley is right, there should be only one.</p>
<p>There is further evidence we can look at. The 1563 Diocesan return indicates only nine houses in Woolsthorpe &#8216;hamlet&#8217;. According to Edmund III writing in 1806, the hamlet consisted of <strong>“the manor-house, two or three small farm-houses, and some thatched cottages”</strong> He does not mention another substantial house. What about the hearth tax records? The collection of hearth taxes was a inaccurate affair. It was collected every year from 1662 until it was scrapped by parliament in the first year of William and Mary, 1689. It was collected twice a year in September and March and was very unpopular. Records were not well kept but in certain years a complete list of names and the number of hearth were returned to the Exchequer in London and survive. Returns survive for 1665-6 and 1671-2 for the parish of Colsterworth, which includes the hamlet of Woolsthorpe, but they do not separate out the Woolsthorpe residents, however with more detective work it is possible to begin to separate them. After the reviewing the tax list and other records it is possible to arrive at the list below, which gives 11 houses, consistent with the 9 in 1563.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-02-at-13.40.31.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-394" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-02 at 13.40.31" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-02-at-13.40.31.html" width="567" height="206" /></a></p>
<p>Some residents of Woolsthorpe were listed in a survey of of Grantham manor in 1650 carried out by Parliamentary commissioners who were assessing the manors of the royal family following the execution of Charles the first in 1649. Some names appear in this list and the above hearth tax assessments. John Senescall Snr was mentioned as a Woolsthorpe resident owing 7d per year to Queen Henrietta, then the widow of the king. Morrice Ingle was also mentioned owing 1d per year. Some names appear in 1650 but not in the hearth tax. Richard Newton (either uncle or great uncle to Isaac) owed 6d, John Webster owed 4d and George Underwater owed 2d. Ellynor Newton is wife and widow of William Newton one of Isaac&#8217;s cousins, and she was buried as “widdow Newton of Woolsthorp 6 Feb 1673. Henry Bagworth was living with Isaac and his mother in 1660, but has his own cottage by 1666. The evidence indicates that there <strong><em>were</em> two substantial houses in Woolsthorpe</strong> &#8211; one occupied by Isaac&#8217;s mother Hannah Smith and one by John and then William Senescall. On the basis of this, it is Samuel Atter who has the real story.</p>
<p><strong>Re-writing history &#8211; the story of a story</strong></p>
<p>It is possible therefore that Edmund III is the source of the story of Isaac&#8217;s birth in the Red Chamber. If Edmund III is not the source of the story, then he certainly elaborates it and codifies it in print and stone, but perhaps the original sin belongs to his father Edmund II, who passed it to his son. It seems unlikely to be Edmund I, who acquired the manor house and estate in 1733, and who knew Isaac personally, and had died by 1769. William Stukeley himself died a few years before in 1765 and had visited worked on an archaeological dig with Edmund I at his hall at Stoke Rocheford in 1739 so they were well known to each other. It is noteworthy therefore that the Turnor story emerges just a few years after William Stukeley and Edmund I have died. In any event Edmund III certainly seems to be the principle projector of the story, and is party to its elaboration. The Turnor family were, at this point and for some time up until the first world war, one of the most powerful and widespread landowners in south Lincolnshire, owning many manors, and whole townships, such as Wragby. Tens of thousands of acres and hundreds of houses, mills and public houses were owned by them. Their sons were all university educated, barristers, landlords, Justices of the Peace, members of parliament. The epitome of the English governing class of the time. Their account was powerful testimony, and could not be countered lightly or easily.</p>
<p>Samuel Atter is from a long line of labourers and cottagers in Woolsthorpe, and takes his story directly from those who lived in the hamlet before and after Isaac was born. There are in fact descendants <strong>still in Woolsthorpe today</strong>. Atter tells us that his story was against the grain of received wisdom, that wisdom came from a Fellow of the Royal Society, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, a JP, and a major landowner and local figure in the area. His view had little chance of holding against such a man. We may be inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to Edmund III, but it may not be a coincidence that he erected the plaque identifying the natal room in the present house at about the same time that he pulled down the evidence of an earlier manor house.</p>
<p>The more compelling alternative story which has emerged here could be tested further. It would be possible to conduct archaeological digs on the site of the old manor house, and also around the present house. If Stukeley is right there will be significant foundations <strong>around</strong> the house, as the present one is smaller. A dig around what is probably the site of the old manor house may turn up interesting finds relating to its construction and size, and unearth artefacts relating to the family, and those before them. The Time Team expressed interest in the idea a few years ago, and perhaps they may show interest again.</p>

				<p><em>Historian Russell Newton shares his story of how a letter from the National Trust led him to discover his family links with Isaac Newton</em></p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, in May 1999, I received a letter from the National Trust at Woolsthorpe manor, the ancestral manor home of Isaac Newton. They asked if I would like to attend an open day they were holding for Isaac&#8217;s relatives. The volunteers for the National Trust at Woolsthorpe had seen a letter in the Times newspaper from Dick Newton &#8211; claiming to be one of his living relatives &#8211; and complaining that the newly-made Baroness Margaret Thatcher was allowed to use Isaac as a supporter on her newly-granted coat of arms. His indignant letter aroused the interest of the volunteers who wondered how many other living relatives there were, and could they be traced?</p>
<p>I filed the letter away and did not reply. I was sure that I was not related. We had our own family story, handed to me by my father from his father &#8211; Arthur Oscar Newton &#8211; who always said that we were descendants of Isaac&#8217;s or something similar. My grandfather died when I was young and my own father &#8211; Dean Arthur Newton &#8211; showed no interest in genealogy. A rift in Arthur&#8217;s family meant that I had no contact with any of the family on his side.</p>
<p>However in 1997 I decided to investigate his claim a little. This was before the internet took off and some preliminary searching showed that Isaac had no children and so we could not be descendants. That seemed to be that, I recognised that he may have had uncles, but searching was not going to be easy, and after all 1642 (when he was born) was a very long way off. So when I received the National Trust letter, I did not reply or travel to Woolsthorpe. My family story seemed to be based on wishful thinking or a mistake, and it would lay unproven one way or another.</p>
<p>Until that is one day in March 2003, when I thought to investigate my grandfather&#8217;s mysterious family. The internet was now improving rapidly and searching online for family members was starting to become easier and more fruitful. I speculated that a general search for my grandfather&#8217;s name might just turn up something interesting. I had only my grandfather&#8217;s birth certificate with his father and mother&#8217;s name, and date and place of birth. To my amazement I was quickly led to a website with my grandfather&#8217;s name, and his mother and father. On it was a link to his father Arthur Henry Newton &#8211; that much I had already. But there was more &#8211; that link led me to his parents, and then their parents. Link after link led me back through generations of Newtons. I was astonished. The website led me to Sir Isaac himself and his uncle Robert Newton who, it turned out, was my own direct ancestor. I had only hoped to find my grandfather&#8217;s family but had instead found dozens of others, over centuries of time. If I had tried the same six years earlier it would have failed completely, because ironically it turned out that all the information I had been looking through was there only because of the open day held by the National Trust in 1999 &#8211; if only I had gone at the time!</p>
<p>Eventually I visited Woolsthorpe and saw an extended family tree on the wall there, and my interest in my own family turned into an interest in Isaac&#8217;s life and the world he lived in. I had the privilege of enough time to look more into those early figures in my branch of the Newton family, headed by Isaac&#8217;s uncle Robert Newton, which turned out to be an interesting story in itself.</p>
<p><strong> The curious tale of Robert Newton, eldest uncle of Sir Isaac Newton</strong></p>
<p>Robert Newton was probably born in Woolsthorpe in 1607 and baptized in the parish church, the second son of Robert. His elder brother Isaac was the natural philosopher&#8217;s father. The records of the quarter sessions at Grantham show that Robert was still living in the family parish in 1637, in his thirtieth year, and in Isaac&#8217;s pedigree prepared by him in 1705 he says that Robert “lived after at Counthorpe”. This is a hamlet in the parish of Castle Bytham, near Swayfield, a few miles from Woolsthorpe. There is little or no trace of it today, other than a road-sign. Robert&#8217;s great grandson John Newton inherited the manor and the small estate on Isaac&#8217;s death, but got himself into serious debt with some high living and was forced to sell the estate to repay. We can find Robert still in Counthorpe on Sunday, 6 March 1642 listed as a resident of the hamlet. He was asked, as was every man over eighteen years, to make an oath called the Protestation Oath, which was taken on that day at the church. There are just 17 male residents in the hamlet, but the return shows that Robert did not make the Oath as there is no cross against his name, and one or two others, whilst every other name has a cross next to it. Sadly, the return from Colsterworth is lost so we cannot see what his father Robert, his other brothers Isaac and Richard, and his uncle Richard, &#8211; all in that parish &#8211; did.</p>
<p>Although Isaac said that Robert lived after at Counthorpe, he did not stay there. In fact Robert moved from Counthorpe not long after the Protestation Oath, and his movements are recorded for us by his great grand-daughter, Michel Newton, who was born in 1718 in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, during Isaac&#8217;s life. According to her recollections (as an old lady and recorded around 1795) her great grandfather Robert “removed to Oundle, co. Northampton about 1640 and became an innkeeper”, she also added that Robert “was at variance with his family” but she doesn&#8217;t venture who or why. One author, CW Foster, terminally discounted this story, writing that he had located Robert&#8217;s inventory dated 1646 in a nearby parish, claiming the parishes of Creeton and Castle Bytham were the same at the time. However, the reasoning is poor, as the two parishes did not merge administratively until centuries later, and the only connection between the inventory and Isaac&#8217;s uncle is the common name and the proximity of the second parish.</p>
<p>This rather piqued my family pride and after some patient research I uncovered clear documentary evidence of the move. The records of the manor of Counthorpe survive and they show that Robert is certainly to be found in Counthorpe on 20 November 1640 where he renews the lease of a substantial farm from Abel Barker of Rutland, who owned the manor, for £50 per year. Incidentally the signature on the lease shows that Robert had an education and his handwriting is very elegant. Despite taking the 16 year lease in 1640, just a few years later, in January 1645, Robert&#8217;s land is sold to John Barker, brother of Abel. Robert has lost the farm, probably unable to pay his half-yearly rent due on 29 September 1644. Robert never appears again in the Counthorpe records, nor do any Newtons during the seventeenth century and beyond.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/signature.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-390" alt="signature" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/signature.html" width="123" height="86" /></a></p>
<p>Financial hardship during the civil war was common, even Isaac once confessed to “using unlawful means to bring us out of distresses” &#8211; distresses were the legal means where creditors could recover their money by taking goods &#8211; by force if necessary. Robert was not the only one to “be reduced” as it was put in those days. His cousin Francis Newton had a farm of reportedly £200 per year at Swayfield, just a mile or two away from Counthorpe, and he was also reduced according to his descendants, because “he spent great parts of it during the late civil wars”. Luckily for him he was helped out by other family (probably his cousins who would later become Baronets at Culverthorpe Hall), and “removed” to Ancaster during the war. Soon after the loss of his farm in Lincolnshire Robert is to be found, as Michel Newton said, in Oundle, and a series of his children are born there, his will of 1677 describes him as an “innholder”. It is not yet clear why he ended up in Oundle about 20 miles to the south, or which of the five or so coaching inns he owned, but it is likely to have been because of some kin or friendship connection with the town.</p>
<p>We do not know what caused the “variance” in the family or who was involved, but we can say that Isaac did not know his uncle Robert until late in his life. In August 1666, when Robert was 59 years old, Sir Isaac submitted his pedigree to the Herald at Grantham, wholly unaware of the existence of his uncle. It was not until 1705 that Isaac discovered the truth, and his early drafts either omit him as before or include just his name, without any wives or children&#8217;s names. Some time soon after descendants of both the Francis Newton once at Swayfield and Robert Newton visited Isaac in London.</p>
<p>So history repeats itself. Isaac discovered his uncle Robert years after he died because of a rift in the family which kept him in the dark, I likewise discovered family kept from me because a rift in my grandfather&#8217;s family. My research into the areas of Isaac&#8217;s life that have been overlooked or given small attention has taken me to fascinating corners of English life in the seventeenth century, revealing a rich and complex picture of family relationships. I intend to publish this in a book to be called <strong>Mr Newton&#8217;s new perspective.</strong> The title is taken from a reference to his new telescope (then called a “perspective”), and to draw attention to a new perspective on his life, taking him to be a man rather than a venerated national icon.</p>

				<p><em>Historian Russell Newton has spent much of his life researching the life Sir Isaac Newton. Here are his top tips on how to approach the question of whether you are related to the great man &#8230; </em></p>
<p>Isaac Newton had an extended family of half-siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, distant cousins, nephews and nieces, and even great uncles.  Many of them carried the surname Newton but there were other surnames too &#8211; as a result of marriages.  His relations down the generations since the seventeenth century (Isaac was born in 1642, and his father in 1606) have in some cases been recorded very carefully.  Other family lines are sketchy, and some known relations have no recorded descendants and are just dead ends, as far as we know.</p>
<p>Many people have come to Isaac&#8217;s ancestral manor (owned and run by the <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/woolsthorpe-manor/">National Trust</a> at Woolsthorpe, near Grantham) over the years and asked if there is any genealogical evidence for their family story that they are related to Isaac&#8217;s family.  They are frequently referred to me to see if I can help.  It is clear that a lot of people have such stories.  Often people write to me with the apparent hope that there is an easy answer to their question “is our story right?”.  I have to disappoint them &#8211; there is usually no easy answer!  If you think you&#8217;re related to Isaac&#8217;s family there are a few things you can do, but remember, it won&#8217;t be easy and it will take time and effort &#8211; unless you are the one in a million.</p>
<p><strong>1. Ask your grannie Newton.</strong>  The source of most of these stories is almost always the older generation. The story is passed from one generation to the next, and often gets worn away or altered with each retelling.  This is inevitable and can&#8217;t be changed, so don&#8217;t worry about it.  Talk to the person who told you about the story, ask them for everything they can remember &#8211; that means everything.  There is no detail which is too small.  Every clue, however small can reduce the infinity of possibilities to something more manageable.  You are probably looking for a needle in a field of haystacks, so narrowing the search to just one haystack is a good start!</p>
<p><strong> 2. Work backward and confirm your own descendants first.</strong>  From the oldest members of your family you can also get a start (if you don&#8217;t have a few generations already) on your own great grandfather, his father and grandfather.  Most families have short memories for this detail, even if they are sure they are related to someone 12 generations earlier.  The internet has made this much easier than before, and there has been a huge increase in interest in family history, which has made large amount of genealogical data available, and importantly searchable, online.  Births, marriages, deaths and census returns back to <a href="http://www.ukcensusonline.com/census/1861.php">1861</a> through to <a href="http://search.findmypast.co.uk/search-world-records/1901-england-wales-and-scotland-census">1901</a> and <a href="http://www.1911census.co.uk/">1911</a> have enough information to get back to your early and mid-Victorian Newton ancestors.  You could try Genealogy-links for <a href="http://www.genealogy-links.co.uk/html/lincs.html">Lincolnshire</a>, <a href="http://www.ukbmd.org.uk/parish">UK-BMD</a> has links to many other sites offering searchable records.  There are some good commercial websites offering searchable databases and a small payment to view individual records. After the the first few generations it becomes much harder, but don&#8217;t lose heart.</p>
<p><strong> 3. Work from the past forward</strong>.  A lot of genealogical information has been put together by families who are, or who claim to be, connected to Isaac&#8217;s Lincolnshire family.  Sadly some of these are unproven, many are cited without any evidence, lists of sources, or any detail; and some are plainly impossible.  The National Trust held an open day in 1999 and invited Newtons from all over to submit their family trees, and the volunteers put together an enormous family tree called The Descendants of Simon Newton of Westby including the &#8216;Father of Modern Science&#8217; Sir Isaac Newton.  The family trees submitted and other papers were retained at the manor house for a time.  After a few years they were given to me for safekeeping and I deposited them at the <a href="http://www.sog.org.uk/">Society of Genealogists</a> in London, where they can be viewed with permission.  There are also several boxes of material arranged into county order.  There are family trees of Isaac&#8217;s family on the internet, mainly based on the work done by the National Trust, but beware, there are some false leads and unproven links to his family.  There has been a proposal to use social media as a project to put the known, documented, family on the internet, with the expectation of improving its quality and depth with contributions from the public community of related families.</p>
<p><strong> 4. Avoid making common genealogical mistakes</strong>.  I have seen many examples of families who provide a long list of names, each representing another generation, starting with a known Isaac relation and ending with their father or mother.  This list seems to satisfy them as enough proof, but it doesn&#8217;t satisfy the genealogist.  Family trees need evidence, they need traceable sources.  Check other people&#8217;s work.  If you have a family tree prepared by an earlier generation &#8211; check it.  If not you may be inadvertently perpetuating an error, however it was made.  When you do your work, keep a note of your reasoning (if it is needed) and your sources, even better &#8211; take a digital copy.  Don&#8217;t reason that two people with the same name in the same parish at the same time are the same person.  Don&#8217;t assume that the same name a decade or so apart in the same place is the same person or the next generation.  Father and sons and mothers and daughters with the same name was the rule rather than the exception until the 1900s.  Not only that but there are fairly frequent cases of two siblings with the same name.  It is a piece of evidence, but inconclusive, you need more!</p>
<p><strong>5. Take your time</strong>.  Genealogy is a very slow, but very rewarding process.  Don&#8217;t be fooled by the program “Who do you think you are?” &#8211; the hard work to find the detail of those celebrities families is done behind the scenes!  But if you find, as I did, that genealogy (and history generally) becomes something of a bug, you will find other sources to look through, and places to visit, which will begin to bring the whole world of your ancestors alive.  You will begin to learn not only about the world that your ancestors lived in, but everyone else&#8217;s as well.  You will want to find out what they wore, how they spoke, what money they spent, how much things cost, what occupations they had, where and how they travelled, what they ate, how they socialised and much more.</p>
<p><strong> 6. Don&#8217;t give up</strong>.  If you don&#8217;t find a link to one of the known lines from Lincolnshire &#8211; don&#8217;t despair!  There are still some people in Isaac&#8217;s family tree who we know nothing about &#8211; what I call “hanging chads”.  No one yet knows what happened to them or whether they have family living.  At the same time there are Newtons who Isaac met or who lived after he died in 1727 who claimed to be cousins, but today we cannot tell how they were related.  So there is scope for you to find a connection with Isaac&#8217;s family even if it is not documented yet.</p>
<p>Russell will be sharing his unique research on Newton&#8217;s family history at the Gravity Fields Festival on Wednesday 24th September at Culverthorpe Hall and Sunday 28th September at the Newton Tree Party, full details on the festival website:</p>
