		<description><![CDATA[Dear Russel Newton


I found your introduction very interesting, especially the uncertainty over Lancaster/Boston. In 2013 I wrote a book entitled Sir Isaac Newton and the Mystery of the Reference Library Indenture based on a deed we found in our library. It eventually led me to a descendant of Newton&#039;s half sister. It cost me a few hundred pounds to self publish the book; if you are interested in is on

Yours sincerely

I have had difficulty tracing mine much further back than the mid 1800s, I would love to see the full family tree from Isaac&#039;s ancestry.
