<p>In 1705 Isaac Newton was knighted by Queen Anne at his old college in Cambridge, not, as some would have it, for services to science or mathematics, reasons for knighting were never published and could only be guessed at, but most likely it was related to his standing for parliament at the impending election. On his return to London he began his look into his ancestry. The Heralds would want to award him a coat of arms or record any coat of arms he was already using. Isaac submitted the fruit of his work to the college of Arms in December 1705 beginning with:</p>
<p>“John Newton of Westby in co. Lincs, desand from the Newtons in Lancastr.”</p>
<p>Westby is a hamlet in the parish of Bassingthorpe, which lies 6 miles south and east of Grantham in south Lincolnshire, a short walk or ride from the Great north Road, the principle road between London and the north east. In 1563 was recorded with 24 families. This might imply a population of say 120. The size of the parish remains fairly static for four and a half centuries whilst the population of the country increases dramatically. In 1801 the parish population was 158 and a century later in 1911 it was back to 116, about the same as in 1563.</p>
<p>[During this time the population of England rose around 1100% from around 3 million to 36 million in 1911. A parish of this size might appear small to modern eyes, with just 24 heads of household, but analysis of the diocesan return shows that about 1 in 5 of the population of Lincolnshire lived in parishes as big or smaller than this, and about 1 in 2 of the population lived in parishes of less than 50 households, with the average parish size of just over 36 families.]</p>
<p>The John Newton who starts Isaac&#8217;s family tree first appears in the archive living and baptizing a family in the parish in the 1540s, and dying there in 1563 in the early years of Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s reign. Isaac recorded that this John had four sons, but he actually had seven sons (Isaac put them into two generations). We are lucky as historians today that we have unprecedented access to archival material, unavailable to Isaac, so we can recognise and correct any mistakes. These seven sons are all traceable. The third son (Richard) was great grandfather to Isaac Newton, the fourth son (William) was ancestor of Sir John Newton of Culverthorpe Hall near Haydour, who became 2nd Baronet in 1662. The sixth son was Robert Newton, who lived in Bassingthorpe and Swayfield, who owned land overseas, and whose brother in law was the first person to be hanged in New England in 1630; and whose son nearly set fire to the Mayflower in 1620 as they sailed across the sea. This Robert was ancestor to a line of farmers who stayed at Bassingthorpe and were alive as he wrote up research, yet Isaac was unable to identify them as his own family, believing them to be “of a different race”. One &#8211; John Newton &#8211; was the churchwarden in 1675, and is remembered by a tablet inside the church. Robert&#8217;s youngest son Francis lived at Swayfield but lost his estate in the civil war, living after at Ancaster, his descendants lived locally at Wilsford, Caythorpe, Fulbeck, and one of them visited Isaac twice in London, by his own account, after the turn of the century. Robert&#8217;s grandson Anthony Newton was groom to the Duke of Rutland at Belvoir for 27 years and moved to Exton in Northants with the Duke&#8217;s daughter after her marriage. It is highly likely that this position was arranged by his cousin, Sir John Newton, at Culverthorpe.</p>
<p>The significant family in the parish was the Conys. Thomas Cony became lord of the manor of Bassingthorpe in 1545 after Richard, his father&#8217;s, death. Both were Merchants of the Staple at Calais. Thomas was captured by the French at Calais in 1558, and held to ransom. Close investigation of the archives has shown that there are earlier family and commerce links between the Newtons and the Conys.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Where John in Westby came from remains a mystery, however the historic fog is beginning to clear. We can now be sure that John did not settle in south Linconlshire from Lancaster or Lancashire, at least not for many generations. It is almost certain that John Newton in Bassingthorpe was a descendant of Merchants of the Staple in Medieval Boston. Boston may not be Lancaster but there are strong connections with Isaac&#8217;s family and Lincolnshire county merchant families close to the Duke of Lancaster in the late 1300s and through the 1400s. But therein lies another story&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>These stories and many more are documented in Russell Newton&#8217;s forthcoming book about Isaac&#8217;s life &#8211; Mr Newton&#8217;s New Perspective.</strong></p>

<p>I found your introduction very interesting, especially the uncertainty over Lancaster/Boston. In 2013 I wrote a book entitled Sir Isaac Newton and the Mystery of the Reference Library Indenture based on a deed we found in our library. It eventually led me to a descendant of Newton&#8217;s half sister. It cost me a few hundred pounds to self publish the book; if you are interested in is on </p>
